# Contributing to Logister

Thanks for your interest in Logister.

## Contribution model

At this stage, we accept:

- Bug reports
- Reproducible issue reports
- Documentation suggestions

Code contributions (including pull requests) are currently by maintainer invitation only.

If you want to contribute code, open an issue first with:

- Problem statement
- Proposed approach
- Scope and impact

A maintainer may invite you as a collaborator when the change is aligned with roadmap and maintenance capacity.

## How to report a bug

Use GitHub Issues and include:

- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment (`Ruby`, `Rails`, database, Redis, OS)
- Logs, stacktrace, or screenshots when available

## Security vulnerabilities

Do not open public issues for security problems. Follow `SECURITY.md`.

## Communication

Please keep reports precise and respectful. Actionable reproduction details are the fastest way to get a fix.
